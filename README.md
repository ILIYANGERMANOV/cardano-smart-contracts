# Ivy token (IVY)
IVY is a **"fair" token** on the Cardano network to support **innovation and development**. 
Ivy token is also the official currency of Ivy DAO and gives premium access to Ivy's eco-system.

The purpose of IVY is to connect inventors, builders, and people fighting for a brighter tomorrow...
So they can freely define and build upon ideas whenever, wherever, and however they want.

The problem Ivy token is trying to solve is to give people the opportunity to work and earn from things they find meaningful:
- A) Inventors (entrepreneurs) can find the capital and the right people for the next big idea 
without sacrificing freedom and innovation to meet investors' financial goals.

- B) Builders (developers, designers, experts) can work and earn freely from one or multiple projects that they find interesting w/o
9-5 contracts, NDAs and things that limit their freedom while practicing their craft.

- C) People (investors, idealists) can support their favorite ideas by providing capital, suggesting ideas/improvements or 
completing tasks that we'll help the project and earn IVY.

Together and with the right system people can both be happy & fulfilled at work while building great stuff that will change the world!
