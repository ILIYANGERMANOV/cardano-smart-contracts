# Ivy token (IVY): Rebuilding the world and "meaning"
IVY is a **"fair" token** on the Cardano network to support **innovation and development**. 
Ivy token is also the official currency of Ivy DAO and provides governance rights and special access in the Ivy eco-system.

The purpose of IVY is to **connect inventors, builders, and people** fighting for a brighter tomorrow...
So they can freely define and build upon ideas whenever, wherever, and however they want.

The problem Ivy token is trying to solve is to give people the **opportunity to work and earn from things they love and find meaningful**:
- A) Inventors (entrepreneurs) can **find the capital and the people** reqiured for the next big idea 
without sacrificing freedom and innovation to meet investors' financial goals.

- B) Builders (developers, designers, experts) can **work and earn freely** from one or multiple projects that they find interesting w/o
9-5 contracts, NDAs and things that limit their freedom while practicing their craft.

- C) People (investors, idealists) can **support meaningful ideas and get ROI** by providing capital, suggesting improvements or 
completing tasks that we'll help the project and earn IVY.

Together and with the right system people can both be **happy & fulfilled at work** while building great stuff that will **change the world!**
